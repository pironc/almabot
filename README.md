# almabot
# Discord bot used to retrieve the daily Almanax informations for Dofus, a MMORPG game

It's not really that useful as it scrape the HTML content of a page giving the daily almanax,
but it can be useful to get this information in Discord.

This program is coded and executed with Python 3.8.4rc1 with the help of BeautifulSoup for HTML scraping.

I'm not 100% sure but if you are using Python 2.7 and above, it should work fine (because of BeautifulSoup)
If you have any issues with a version lower than 2.7, maybe install a newer version of Python.

Simply run the program and start using the bot. Every single line of code is detailed, so you know what to edit
if you want to make a discord bot from an already existing bot, and/or if you don't know how to start with BeautifulSoup and Python.

I plan to keep this project updated with more features, for example to get the almanx with a discord channel editing every day at midnight
so you don't have to type any command, or add even more commands with more datas about the game extracted from Dofus' website itself.
